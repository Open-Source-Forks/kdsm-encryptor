# KDSM Encryptor

---

## (\*\^▽\^\*) Overview

> A secure message encryption-decryption web app using a custom `Keyed Dynamic Shift Matrix (KDSM)` algorithm. Built with **Next.js** for frontend, styled using **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS**, and optimized for high-performance on large inputs.

> Note: You will probably see a lot of kaomojis as KDSM adopts this as a new trend and they are better than emojis. (◔‿◔)

## (ง •̀\_•́)ง Join the Revolution!

Hey there, crypto enthusiasts and security-minded developers! (｡◕‿◕｡)

Are you passionate about **cutting-edge encryption** and **innovative security solutions**? Do you believe in creating tools that put privacy back in the hands of users? Then **KDSM Encryptor** is calling your name!

We're building something **extraordinary** - a next-generation encryption system that's not just secure, but blazingly fast and user-friendly. This isn't just another project; it's a movement towards democratizing advanced cryptography.

(＄\_＄) The core contributors and maintainers will also get hired by us to work remotely on another project and will be paid handsomely! (\*￣︶￣\*)

_Lightning-fast encryption that scales with your needs_

### (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ✧ Performance Benchmarks

Our KDSM algorithm delivers exceptional performance across various input sizes:

| Operation      | Input Size  | Processing Time | Throughput      |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Encryption** | 1,000 words | 0.9 ms          | ~1.1M words/sec |
| **Decryption** | 1,000 words | 0.5 ms          | ~2.0M words/sec |
| **Round Trip** | 1,000 words | 1.4 ms          | ~714K words/sec |

_Benchmarks performed on modern hardware with optimized KDSM implementation_

**Key Performance Highlights:**

- (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ✧ **Sub-millisecond processing** for typical message sizes
- (￣▽￣)ノ **Linear scaling** with input size
- (◔‿◔) **Faster decryption** than encryption by design
- ヽ(´▽\`)/ **Production-ready performance** for real-time applications

## (＾◡＾) Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Appwrite instance (local or cloud)
- Basic knowledge of React/Next.js

### (´∀｀) Setting Up the Appwrite Backend

1. **Install Appwrite CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g appwrite-cli
   ```

2. **Initialize Appwrite Project**

   ```bash
   appwrite init project
   ```

3. **Create Database & Collections**

   ```bash
   # Create main database
   appwrite databases create --databaseId "kdsm-main" --name "KDSM Main Database"

   # Create messages collection
   appwrite databases createCollection \
     --databaseId "kdsm-main" \
     --collectionId "messages" \
     --name "Encrypted Messages" \
     --permissions "read(\"any\")" "write(\"any\")"
   ```

4. **Set up Authentication**

   ```bash
   # Enable email/password auth
   appwrite users create --userId "unique()" --email "test@example.com" --password "testpass123"
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   # Copy example env file
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Add your Appwrite credentials
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

6. **Database Schema Setup**
   ```bash
   # Run the database initialization script
   npm run setup:database
   ```

### ヽ(´▽\`)/ Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Idrisvohra9/kdsm-encryptor.git
cd kdsm-encryptor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
